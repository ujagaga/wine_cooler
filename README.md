# wine_cooler

I was looking to buy a wine cooler, but they were all too big, so I decided to build my own.
Using Arduino Nano (or any other board would do), DS18B20 temperature probe and a IIC 128x32 oled display.

There is one button to choose from either red or white wine due to different reccomended storing temperature.

I am using a 3D printer to build bottle seat on the metal shelf holders.

A CPU heatpipe cooler is to cool down Peltier module and an aluminium tin plate cools the inside of the box.
